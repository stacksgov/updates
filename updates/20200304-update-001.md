# Stacks Governance Update #1 - 4 March, 2020

## Intro

The Stacks Governance initiative was launched earlier this month. This is the first of a series of regular updates on the initiative.

The initiative was announced in [this post](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/stacks-foundation-developing-governance-for-blockstack/10335) on the community forum by Brittany on February 7. You can refer to that post for further details. In brief, the goal of this initiative is to further the process of developing and decentralizing the governance of the Stacks blockchain and ecosystem as the launch of [Stacks 2.0](https://blog.blockstack.org/announcing-the-blockstack-whitepaper-2-0/) approaches. Blockstack PBC, which up to now has acted as sole steward of R&D, and of support more generally, for the entire Blockstack ecosystem, [committed](https://blog.blockstack.org/a-path-to-decentralization/) in 2018 to further decentralization of the Blockstack network and protocol. Realizing this goal will require the community to take a more active role in governance. It will also entail establishing a new, independent entity, a Stacks Foundation.

My name is Lane Rettig, and I’m an independent researcher working with PBC on governance and acting as a liaison between PBC and the community. I’ll be active on many community channels, including Discord (especially the #governance working group channel), Discourse, and writing and sharing these updates.

For the past few years I've been very active in the governance of Ethereum, and I think there is a great deal that the Blockstack community can learn from the governance of Ethereum and other blockchain platforms and communities in practice: both positive examples to be emulated and pitfalls to be avoided. I’m extremely excited about this opportunity to get to know the entire Blockstack community, and to iterate together to discover and develop the best governance mechanisms for this unique ecosystem.

The Stacks blockchain, and the entire Blockstack ecosystem, is uniquely positioned and has an exciting opportunity to put into place a robust, mature decentralized governance system.

As my role is primarily to steward this process and to collect and interpret community sentiment, you should think of me as being at your service. Please do not hesitate to reach out at any time to ask questions or propose ideas. See the [Get Involved](#get-involved) section at the end of this update for information on how best to do that!


## These Updates

I will post these updates regularly to share the latest progress of the governance project with the community. They’ll include progress since the previous update, including links to resources, as well as information on what’s planned for the coming week. Think of them as a “project standup.” These updates are written and published at [https://github.com/stacksgov/updates](https://github.com/stacksgov/updates). You may contribute to the next update by opening an issue or pull request in that repository, and you may “Watch” the repository to see all updates.


## Community Calls

We’ll also be hosting regular community calls to update the community about the progress of the project, and to give everyone a chance to have their voice heard. An initial, introductory call was held on February 13, and a second call was held on March 2 ([recording](https://youtu.be/jAEHyq4TKeI)). Going forward, calls will be held every Wednesday at 7am PT/10am ET/3pm UTC/5pm CEST/10pm CST (please reach out on Discord if you'd like to be added to the recurring email invitation). You can find the proposed agenda for the next call [here](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues/5). Please feel free to propose additions/amendments!

You can find resources from prior calls, including recordings and slides, at [https://github.com/stacksgov/resources/tree/master/calls](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources/tree/master/calls).


## Stacks Foundation

Brittany shared an update on [this week's call](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues/3#issuecomment-593482885) on progress towards establishing a Stacks Foundation that is independent of Blockstack PBC. (See her initial description of the Foundation in [Stacks Foundation: Developing Governance for Blockstack](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/stacks-foundation-developing-governance-for-blockstack/10335).)

Blockstack PBC is looking into establishing a Singapore entity for the Stacks Foundation, and is beginning to consider candidates for its board. In addition to a more formal board of directions—individuals who are not already controlling stakeholders in PBC, and who have relevant expertise—there will likely also be a more informal set of "members" who can also participate in Foundation governance. Brittany will share more information on this process as it becomes available. Watch the [full recording of the call](https://youtu.be/jAEHyq4TKeI) for more.


## Listening Campaign

In the early stages of this governance initiative, one of the most important things to do is to listen. The goal of a listening campaign is to understand the thoughts, feelings, hopes, and fears of community members, to learn what the community feels about the mission and values of the Blockstack and Stacks blockchain projects, about what’s working well now, and about what could be done differently in the future. This will involve multiple steps, including a governance survey to be shared as broadly as possible throughout the community, and one-on-one interviews with core project stakeholders.


### Community Survey

In an effort to better understand the broader Blockstack community, and the view of community members towards governance, we’re planning to conduct a governance survey, inspired by a similar survey conducted in the Ethereum community last year. Learn more about the survey, the goals of the survey, and how to contribute, in [this forum thread](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/community-governance-survey/10387).

The survey will contain basic demographic questions (e.g., location, whether the participant identifies as a member of the community, their role in the community, length of membership), questions about the mission, vision, and values of the community, questions about the respective roles of PBC and the new Stacks Foundation, and questions about how the platform/community should be governed in the future.

The more responses we get to the survey, the more we'll learn and the more valuable it will be. To this end, we'll ask for everyone's support to help spread the word about the survey. Note that all are welcome to participate, including those who don't necessarily identify as active Blockstack community members.


### Stakeholder Interviews

This week, I began the process of interviewing core stakeholders, both at Blockstack PBC and throughout the community. These interviews are open-ended and aimed at fact-finding: hearing the perspective of core stakeholders on what is and is not working well today, and about how the project can and should be governed in the future. I will share the notes from these interviews, including a summary of overall findings and community sentiment. If you would like to nominate someone to be interviewed, you may [use this form](https://forms.gle/QG3NdBFvXRj246Wr6).

## Learnings

Here are some things that I've learned about the Blockstack community, and about governance, over the past few days.

- The community is extremely active, and many community members have a strong affinity for the project and for the community, and are strongly aligned with its mission, vision, and values. I've struggled to keep up with the forum, Discord channels, and everywhere else the community is active!
- After reading Muneeb's recent blog update on the challenges and opportunities ahead for App Mining, [The Next Phase of App Mining](https://blog.blockstack.org/the-next-phase-of-app-mining/), I've been thinking a lot about how we can overcome some of these challenges, and about what role the community and the Stacks Foundation might play in App Mining going forward. As Muneeb pointed out [on the forum](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/30m-stx-to-give-away/10391/5), there is a separate pool of 30M STX tokens reserved specifically for App Mining. What role do grants and bounties have to play in incentivizing the development of good apps on Blockstack?
- A very interesting and pragmatic definition of good governance came up in one of the stakeholder interviews this week: A society that's governed well is one that I'd be happy to be reborn into, regardless of socio-economic status. How can we bake this helpful [Veil of Ignorance](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/) principle into Stacks governance? 🤔
- Not Blockstack specific, but: governance of cryptographic networks is still hard, and presents many complex challenges. Witness the [debate over changing the proof of work algorithm in Ethereum](https://hudsonjameson.com/2020-03-02-progpow-the-ethereum-community-speaks/), and [drama in the STEEM community](https://www.coindesk.com/why-crypto-should-care-about-justin-suns-steem-drama), two examples just from the past few days!


## Get involved

Stacks governance is a community-run initiative! As such, it cannot work without your help, and without the input of as many community members as possible. _You do not need anyone’s permission to get involved and contribute to the initiative._ The #governance working group channel on [Blockstack Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ny6wGkx) is a great place to begin getting involved, as many community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [governance category](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/governance) on the Blockstack Community Forum which need your input.
