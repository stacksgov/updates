## Intro/about these updates

Please see the [previous update](https://github.com/stacksgov/updates/blob/update-002/updates/20200304-update-001.md) for more information on these updates, and on the governance initiative more generally. You can track the overall progress of the initiative on the [master project board](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/projects/1).


## Community Calls

Governance working group calls happen **every Wednesday** at 7am PT/10am ET. Please reach out on Discord if you'd like to be added to the recurring email invitation. The next call is scheduled for next Wednesday, March 18. You can see the agenda and propose topics in [this issue](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues/9).

Call #3 happened this past Wednesday, March 11. In addition to the usual set of updates, we had a lengthy, engaging conversation about the plans for the Stacks Foundation and the role of the community in the Foundation and in governance. You can view the [recording of the call](https://youtu.be/d7cGndifjR0) and see the [notes](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources/issues/12).

You can find recordings, notes, and slides from previous calls [on GitHub](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources/tree/master/calls).


## Listening Campaign

In the early stages of this governance initiative, one of the most important things to do is to listen. The goal of a listening campaign is to understand the thoughts, feelings, hopes, and fears of community members, to learn what the community feels about the mission and values of the Blockstack and Stacks blockchain projects, about whatâ€™s working well now, and about what could be done differently in the future. This will involve multiple steps, including a governance survey to be shared as broadly as possible throughout the community, and one-on-one interviews with core project stakeholders.


### Community Survey

We made rapid progress on the survey over the past week. A first draft has been completed, containing seven sections: Demographics, Community, Constitution, Governance, Blockstack PBC, Independent Governance. We plan to launch the survey, beginning with the governance working group, within the next couple of days.

In response to some excellent questions from the community, one thing I personally gave a lot of thought to this past week is the goals of the survey, and what we plan to do with the results. You can see my thoughts in [this forum post](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/community-governance-survey/10387/10). While editing the survey, I dropped a number of questions that didn't seem essential, and reworded others to make them more actionable.

Learn more about the survey, the goals of the survey, and how to contribute, in [this forum thread](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/community-governance-survey/10387).

The more responses we get to the survey, the more we'll learn and the more valuable it will be. To this end, we'll ask for everyone's support to help spread the word about the survey. Note that all are welcome to participate, including those who don't necessarily identify as active Blockstack community members.


### Stakeholder Interviews

This week, I continued to conduct one-on-one interviews with core stakeholders, both at Blockstack PBC and throughout the community. I've conducted five so far, and have begun to work on cleaning up the notes to share them. I have a number of nominations for future interviewees and will reach out to them to schedule more calls.

These interviews are open-ended and aimed at fact-finding: hearing the perspective of core stakeholders on what is and is not working well today, and about how the project can and should be governed in the future. I will share the notes from these interviews, including a summary of overall findings and community sentiment. If you would like to nominate someone to be interviewed, you may [use this form](https://forms.gle/QG3NdBFvXRj246Wr6).

All of these are open for public contribution via issues and pull requests.


## Learnings

Here are some things that I've learned about the Blockstack community, and about governance, over the past few days.

- Different stakeholders that I've spoken to have very different views on some core aspects of governance, but there is a surprisingly high degree of alignment on values and mission. In my opinion, this is a positive form of conflict known as [task conflict](https://www.vantageleadership.com/our-blog/not-all-conflicts-are-equal-3-types-of-conflict/) and, in the process of sharing our perspectives and considering the perspectives of others, we'll arrive at a better form of governance than any individual or organization could on their own - which is, after all, the whole point of this initiative! ðŸ¤“
- When designing a survey, it's essential to be as clear as possible, with yourself and with all stakeholders, about the purpose of the survey, and about the purpose and action item attached to each individual question. If you can't quickly come up with a purpose and action item for a question, drop it or reword it!
- When people begin to ask hard questions - something that happened, for the first time, on [this week's call](https://youtu.be/d7cGndifjR0) - it's a very positive sign because it means that people are taking the initiative seriously, and beginning to think through the importance and implications of governance.

## Get involved

Stacks governance is a community-run initiative! As such, it cannot work without your help, and without the input of as many community members as possible. _You do not need anyoneâ€™s permission to get involved and contribute to the initiative._ The #governance working group channel on [Blockstack Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ny6wGkx) is a great place to begin getting involved, as many community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [governance category](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/governance) on the Blockstack Community Forum which need your input.
