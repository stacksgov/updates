Governance working group calls happen **every Wednesday** at 7am PT/10am ET. Please reach out on Discord if you'd like to be added to the recurring email invitation. The next call is scheduled for next Wednesday, April 1. You can see the agenda and propose topics in [this issue](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues/19).

Call #5 happened this past Wednesday, March 25. We discussed the [official release of the survey on Twitter](https://twitter.com/blockstack/status/1242784590378553345), progress on the survey, one-on-one interviews, and the comprehensive governance proposal (see below). Brittany updated us on progress for creation of the initial Stacks Foundation and recent challenges.

## Listening Campaign

In the early stages of this governance initiative, one of the most important things to do is to listen. The goal of a listening campaign is to understand the thoughts, feelings, hopes, and fears of community members, to learn what the community feels about the mission and values of the Blockstack and Stacks blockchain projects, about what’s working well now, and about what could be done differently in the future. This will involve multiple steps, including a governance survey to be shared as broadly as possible throughout the community, and one-on-one interviews with core project stakeholders.

### Community Survey

The survey was [posted on the Blockstack twitter page](https://twitter.com/blockstack/status/1242784590378553345) on March 25, 2020. We are asking the community to share this throughout their own distribution channels for maximum reach. A direct link to the survey can be found below.

Learn more about the survey, the goals of the survey, and past contributions in [this forum thread](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/community-governance-survey/10387).

The more responses we get to the survey, the more we'll learn and the more valuable it will be. To this end, we'll ask for everyone's support to help spread the word about the survey. Note that all are welcome to participate, including those who don't necessarily identify as active Blockstack community members.

### Stakeholder Interviews

This week, Lane continues to clean up, share, and work toward release of the notes for eight one-on-one stakeholder interviews.

These interviews are open-ended and aimed at fact-finding: hearing the perspective of core stakeholders on what is and is not working well today, and about how the project can and should be governed in the future. I will share the notes from these interviews, including a summary of overall findings and community sentiment.

## Comprehensive Governance Proposal

The largest single deliverable for [phase one](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/projects/1) of the Stacks governance initiative is a preliminary comprehensive proposal for how to govern the Stacks ecosystem, including a future Stacks Foundation.

This week, Lane and Brittany discussed that the proposal is nearly ready for release to the working group for review, however there are still a few details around the new entity for the Stacks Foundation that need to be cleared up first. Lane discussed possibly splitting the "monolithic proposal" into sections to speed up the release.

## Get involved

Stacks governance is a community-run initiative! As such, it cannot work without your help, and without the input of as many community members as possible. _You do not need anyone’s permission to get involved and contribute to the initiative._ The #governance working group channel on [Blockstack Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ny6wGkx) is a great place to begin getting involved, as many community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [governance category](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/governance) on the Blockstack Community Forum which need your input.
