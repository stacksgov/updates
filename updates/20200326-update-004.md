# Stacks Governance Update #4 - 26 March, 2020

## Intro/about these updates

Please see the [Update 1](https://github.com/stacksgov/updates/blob/update-002/updates/20200304-update-001.md) for more information on these updates, and on the governance initiative more generally. You can track the overall progress of the initiative on the [master project board](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/projects/1).

## Community Calls

Governance working group calls happen **every Wednesday** at 7am PT/10am ET. Please reach out on Discord if you'd like to be added to the recurring email invitation. The next call is scheduled for next Wednesday, March 25. You can see the agenda and propose topics in [this issue](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues/16).

Call #5 happened this past Wednesday, March 25.



Call #4 happened this past Wednesday, March 18. We discussed progress on the survey, one-on-one interviews, and the comprehensive governance proposal (see below). We also heard a presentation from DanT about the status of the governance projects and some outstanding questions and challenges, and a detailed update from Brittany about the status of and plans for the Stacks Foundation project, and discussed some questions the community has about the project. You can view the [recording of the call](https://youtu.be/u8lZsVFCFtc) and see the [notes](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources/issues/19).

You can find recordings, notes, and slides from previous calls [on GitHub](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources/tree/master/calls).


## Listening Campaign

In the early stages of this governance initiative, one of the most important things to do is to listen. The goal of a listening campaign is to understand the thoughts, feelings, hopes, and fears of community members, to learn what the community feels about the mission and values of the Blockstack and Stacks blockchain projects, about what’s working well now, and about what could be done differently in the future. This will involve multiple steps, including a governance survey to be shared as broadly as possible throughout the community, and one-on-one interviews with core project stakeholders.


### Community Survey

Over the past week, we finished writing the survey, factoring in feedback from a number of community members. Most of the members of the governance working group took the survey, providing some preliminary feedback. As of today, the final feedback has been factored in, and the survey is ready to be distributed to a wider audience. We're just waiting to coordinate the best way to do this with PBC.

Learn more about the survey, the goals of the survey, and how to contribute, in [this forum thread](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/community-governance-survey/10387).

The more responses we get to the survey, the more we'll learn and the more valuable it will be. To this end, we'll ask for everyone's support to help spread the word about the survey. Note that all are welcome to participate, including those who don't necessarily identify as active Blockstack community members.


### Stakeholder Interviews

This week, I continued to conduct one-on-one interviews with core stakeholders, both at Blockstack PBC and throughout the community. I conducted eight calls, and am in the process of cleaning up the notes and sharing them with each interviewee to review before posting the notes publicly. I will begin posting the notes over the next few days.

These interviews are open-ended and aimed at fact-finding: hearing the perspective of core stakeholders on what is and is not working well today, and about how the project can and should be governed in the future. I will share the notes from these interviews, including a summary of overall findings and community sentiment.


## Comprehensive governance proposal

The largest single deliverable for [phase one](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/projects/1) of the Stacks governance initiative is a preliminary comprehensive proposal for how to govern the Stacks ecosystem, including a future Stacks Foundation. This week, I delivered a rough draft of this proposal to PBC stakeholders. It includes some background on challenges in crypto-ecosystem governance in general, preliminary findings from the survey and one on one interviews, and specific proposals for addressing the challenges and for governance moving forward. I'll share this proposal with the community for comment as soon as it's been cleaned up a tiny bit more and is ready for comment, and I look forward to discussing it and hearing everyone's feedback.

* Independent [stacksgov organization](https://github.com/stacksgov) on Github, which includes a set of [resources](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources) (including regular working group [calls](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources/tree/master/calls)), a [project management board](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/projects/1), and these regular [updates](https://github.com/stacksgov/weekly). All of these are open for public contribution via issues and pull requests.


## Learnings

Here are some things that I've learned about the Blockstack community, and about governance, over the past few days.

- One common theme that came up, both in the one on one interviews and in the preliminary survey responses, is that, while the community has a high degree of trust in Blockstack PBC, they still feel that PBC could be more transparent about its decision-making process - something that everyone I spoke to agrees is essential to build trust and a sense of legitimacy in governance. Brittany shared on this week's call that, while PBC wants to be as transparent as possible, it sometimes takes a while to share information because it needs to undergo legal review first. In response to this, there is now an outstanding proposal [to establish a community observer role](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues/17) for PBC's research calls.
- Another common theme from the interviews is that, while App Mining had good intent, its execution did not go well. Muneeb shared his thoughts about these challenges, and possible next steps, in a [blog post](https://blog.blockstack.org/the-next-phase-of-app-mining/) a few days ago. Most would like to see App Mining redesigned and relaunched, but think it needs big changes.
- In non-Stacks news, the drama in the STEEM community continues to play out. The community took a bold step to "fork out" Justin Sun's Steemit. If this experiment works, it will be proof positive that _the blockchain is ultimately in the hands of the community._ See [commentary](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1240605327122464768?s=20).

## Get involved

Stacks governance is a community-run initiative! As such, it cannot work without your help, and without the input of as many community members as possible. _You do not need anyone’s permission to get involved and contribute to the initiative._ The #governance working group channel on [Blockstack Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ny6wGkx) is a great place to begin getting involved, as many community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [governance category](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/governance) on the Blockstack Community Forum which need your input.
